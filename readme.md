# Terminal Bank Balance Tracker, JSON/txt

This program folder is a quick write up for practice with JSON and txt file types, taking in inputs and saving them to local files.

app.py is the main file type of be ran, the txt_test_log was a test run in attempting to write data to a .txt file and manipulate it.

file_manager utilizes the JSON file system to store data locally and access it through the program.

Would like to come back in the future and refactor and add more details and features to this project.
